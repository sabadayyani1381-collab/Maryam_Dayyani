    "A super-advanced text-prediction machine.\n",
    "Similar to how your phone predicts the next word when you type, but thousands of times more powerful.\n",

    "- Have conversations\n",
    "- Help with homework or explanations\n",

    "## 🧠 Hallucination?\n",

    "\n",
    "Hallucination means the model makes up information that is false, inaccurate, or completely fabricated, but presents it as if it were true.\n",

    "✔️ Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fictional facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "User: “Who won the Nobel Prize in 2020 for physics?”\n",
    "Model: “It was Dr. John Smith.” (Incorrect)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Made-up citations:\n",
    "\n",
    "User: “Give me a reference for this topic.”\n",
    "Model: “Doe, J. (2019). Advanced AI Studies. Journal of AI.” (Doesn’t exist)\n",

    "\n",
    "User: “Explain how unicorns fly.”\n",
    "Model: Provides a plausible-sounding explanation even though unicorns aren’t real.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Why Do LLMs Hallucinate?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs like GPT are not **“thinking machines”** — they are pattern predictors. They generate text based on statistical patterns learned from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key reasons:\n",
    "### 1️⃣ They predict the most likely next word\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained to continue text plausibly, not necessarily correctly.\n",
    "They don’t have a true understanding of facts—they just generate what sounds right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "Imagine a very smart autocomplete keyboard—it will suggest the most probable next word, even if it’s wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Training data is imperfect\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs learn from text on the internet, books, code, articles…\n",
    "Some of that data is wrong, biased, or fictional.\n",
    "The model can reproduce errors from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Lack of real-world grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs don’t access real-time data (unless connected to a knowledge base or plugin).\n",
    "They can’t check facts on their own—they rely on patterns they learned during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Ambiguity in the prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user asks vague or creative questions, the model may generate plausible-sounding but incorrect answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: “Explain how humans breathe underwater” → generates imaginative explanation, because it tries to be helpful even if impossible."
